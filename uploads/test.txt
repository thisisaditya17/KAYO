Communication between frontend and backend is usually handled by the HTTP protocol. Frontend sends a request to change resource or retrieve data, while backend returns appropriate results.

In this form, when any changes occur on the backend, the frontend is not aware of them. As a result, in order to stay up-to-date, it is necessary to make requests at regular intervals and check if something has changed. This is not very convenient for users and unnecessarily burdens servers.

An alternative method is to use two-way communication, such as with sockets. Then, when a resource changes on the backend side, we can send a message to the frontend. This can be a changed value or an info that something has changed and a request has to be made to be up-to-date. This way, the frontend will be notified when something actually changes and will not make unnecessary requests.
