One day, you are walking through a prehistoric forest, you hear a twig snap behind you. You turn, slowly, hoping that it isn't what you think it is. Standing behind you is a Stegosaurus, chomping away on some leafy ferns. You breathe a sigh of relief. You were afraid it was a predator with its eye on you as a tasty snack. Of course, that was millions of years ago, so it could only happen in your imagination. In fact it was so long ago that there were no people around at all; there weren't even any apes or monkeys yet!

The prehistoric world of the dinosaurs is both strange and exciting. Many things were very different from what you see today. Some dinosaurs stood taller than buildings, and others weighed as much as your entire family put together. Some dinosaurs were small enough to fit in your backpack. Some would not hesitate to eat you on the spot if they were hungry. Others spent all day chomping on ferns and other plants. The one kind of dinosaur that never existed was a dull dinosaur!
