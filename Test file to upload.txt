Music production is the process of developing, creating and refining recorded music for public presentation. Music production can refer to the entire lifecycle of a piece of music—from songwriting and composition to recording and sound design to mixing and mastering.

Despite the broad definition, every workflow in modern music production has one thing in common—digital tools.

Thanks to today’s technology, music production is more accessible than ever before.

For the lowest price in history any musician can set up a home studio and get started producing music.

A music producer can have several different roles depending on the genre of music and the type of workflow.

In the traditional recording process, a music producer acts in a similar way to the director of a film.

They create a vision for the material and advise the musicians artistically on how to realize it.

During a recording session the producer acts as a coordinator and provides organizational help. They also offer creative input and notes on the musicians’ delivery and the technical choices made by the engineer.
