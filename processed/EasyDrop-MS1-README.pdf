However, it implies the **need to prioritize and manage software development tasks effectively.**  \"Priority 3 - Fix all bugs present up to this point\" suggests an existing backlog of bugs that need addressing.\n\n**Context 4:** The problem is the need for **a structured development process that ensures timely delivery of high-quality software while remaining adaptable to unforeseen issues.** The solution involves implementing a two-week sprint cycle for development, which promotes agility, frequent evaluation, and better team communication.\n\nTherefore, identifying the specific problem depends on which text portion you're focusing on. Each excerpt highlights different challenges and proposed solutions within a broader software development context. \n"
